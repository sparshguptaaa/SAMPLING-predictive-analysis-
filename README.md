# SAMPLING-predictive-analysis-
its a sampling technique where we used five sampling method to train five models on credit card dataset


Best sampling per model:

Logistic Regression → Sampling5

Decision Tree → Sampling5

Random Forest → Sampling5 (100% accuracy)

KNN → Sampling5

SVM → Sampling3 (slightly better than others)

👉 Conclusion:
Sampling5 performs best overall, especially for tree-based models.
